Branch.io PHP SDK (unofficial)

This is simple wrapper around Branch.io HTTP API.
Original documentation can be found [https://branchmetrics.github.io/docs/pages/apps/api/] here

I have nothing related to Branch services, i created this library because i used branch, i wrote this simple
wrapper and i want to share it with community.

Create manager:

    $manager = new Manager([
      'key' => 'key_test',
      'secret' => 'key_secret'
    ]);

Cheers.
